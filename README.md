13 April: # building an app following LEVELUP Tutorial Meteor and React

  I tried to copy the code in the video tutorial #3.  https://youtu.be/D-_8rjc7Xds

  This is throwing two errors:
  - modules-runtime.js?hash=939c79d…:95 Uncaught Error: Cannot find module './layouts/mainLayout.jsx'
  - kadira_flow-router.js?hash=513a418…:509 There is no route for the path: /

Anyone has any idea what I am doing wrong?  I think I copied the codes in the video exactly....?

13 April: Other fellow coders pointed out that I got two typos - my code was "mainLayout" instead of "MainLayout".
Now it works fine. Moving onto video 4.

15 April: Completed up to tutorial #11.

16 April: Completed tutorial up to #15. But, now meteor is no longer loading properly.  It gets stuck in the terminal and does not load on the browser at all.
Anybody any idea how to solve this issue?

When I remove stolinski:stylus-multi from the meteor package, it works without styling. But, it was working with the package until yesterday...though it was slow loading.

It turns out that the above issue is only on my pc.  It works with another pc and mac.

17 April: Tutorial No16.  Parameter based rountes - error - Resolution.findOne not working. Undefined..

19 April: Completed up to Tutorial No20
     Tutorial No17  Json file for Public and Private settings keeps causing error when running meteor.  I did not find a solution for this.  Does anybody have an idea why this is happening? Is it just me? 
     Tutorial No18 check variable - Make sure to put capical letter on the type- e.g. check (resolution, String)
     Tutorial No19 npm command did not work in the Terminal in my mac.  So, installed Node js (which includes npm).
     and reinstalled meteor using curl command as normal for mac.
      The issue from Tutorial No17 keeps coming back, so I deleted the json file created in Tutorial No17, and the error disappeared.
